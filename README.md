* Understanding customer preferences: Analyzing customer preferences and knowing that the top-selling categories on Amazon are **Electronics, Computer and Accessories, Home and Kitchen** aids in the development of products that align with market demands, reducing the risks of launching offerings that may not resonate with the target audience that thereby reduces churn rates.
* Improving sales: By recommending products that are similar or complimentary to the ones users have purchased, we can increase the chances of cross-selling and up-selling. This can result in higher revenue and profit for the company.
